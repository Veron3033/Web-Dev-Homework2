    <p>You can return to the past, but it's empty now. Your old school is there, but your friends aren't. Your childhood home stands, but your family doesn't live there. The coffee shop you loved still exists, but the barista who knew your order has left. The streets are familiar, but the faces aren't. The buildings are the same, but the energy has changed. The past is a place, but the present is where life happens.</p>
